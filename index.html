                    Along with Social Studies class and Technology my group and I created this amazing project, which was developed during this last trimester and consisted on  the creation of an academic magazine, with the one we were looking to transmit our love and passion for learning about the firsts civilizations and the history of our past, to other students or people interested. My team consisted of Juan Bautista as the researcher of the magazine, Sofia Mustaffa as the graphic designer, and me (Mariana Ortega) as the editor and writer, just as the graphic designer. <br>  

                    Thanks to this amazing project we got to learn a lot about the Aztec civilization, now the passion we had for learning about all these topics has increased, and we want to impact and transfer our knowledge to the whole world, and Mr. Jaime, our technology teacher, made this possible by supporting and shearing with us all his abilities so we could create our own website to publish this incredible magazine, and after a long time working with dedication and all our hearts in the project, we can now say it is finished, we are so proud of what we have done, so we invite yâ€™all to read and discover our magazine in the link below. <br>
